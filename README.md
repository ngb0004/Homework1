# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor
For this Homework we did a code refactor in order to make the website meet accessibility standards and use semantic elements instead of just using div's everywhere.
For the HTML element i added alt tags to the images to increase accessibility.
first, I used header tags around the nav bar and used the nav tags on what I considered the nav bar.
Then I used a main tag on the next div surrounding the divs that I made into sections. 
I made the side bar an aside and left the div’s inside it as divs because I didn’t think there was a better element for them.
I finished by making the bottom div a footer because that’s what I thought was best for that tag.
I went through the css and tried to adjust to what I had done and simplify things a bit.
I fixed the search engine optimization button and took out one div that wasn’t needed.
